# Mina Sample Projects

This repository contains various sample projects that I have completed while learning mina protocol

## Getting Started

Firstly you must make sure that you have the latest version of the zkApp CLI installed: 

```bash
npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

To create a zk project:

```bash
zk project <your_project_name>
```

Then you must answer the questions prompted in terminal. For local development you can answer the questions as follows;

* Create ui project too ? => next
* GitHub Pages ? => no
* Typescript ? =? yes
* Eslint ? => no
* Tailwind css ? => no

Each sample project contains a more detailed readme file
